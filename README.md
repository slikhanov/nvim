## TODO

1. Narrow down treesitter languages, having all enabled is an overkill.

## Plugins

### nvim-treesitter

This is basically [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) integration into NVim.
Suppose to give advanced and fast highlighting as well as other things. Didn't tinker with it much
yet. Link: [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).
